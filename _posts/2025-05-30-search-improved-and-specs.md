title: The Magic World of Browser's Privacy
---

While researching for a guide on how to properly write RSpec tests and avoid flaky specs, I once again ran into the growing frustration of modern web searches â€” cluttered with SEO spam, AI junk, and irrelevant results.
That experience led me to reflect not just on search engines, but also on the browsers we rely on daily. I realized how many of the popular ones are no longer user-friendly â€” especially when it comes to respecting our privacy and security.
Curious, I dove into the world of alternative browsers. Beyond the better-known options like Brave, DuckDuckGo, and Vivaldi, I discovered lesser-known but powerful tools like the Mullvad Browser â€” each with its own strengths and trade-offs.  
In the link section you will find some of the source I've used for this.

The colonnade is quite long, extending into the distance where it appears to darken and become less distinct.  The columns are tall and slender, classical in style, with bases and capitals.  Between the columns, there are walls with what appear to be stone or marble plaques or memorials, possibly tombstones, set into them.  Small floral arrangements are visible in some of these niches.  The floor of the colonnade is paved, and the shadows of the columns are cast long and distinctly on the ground, indicating a strong light source from one side.  A small, rectangular object, possibly a drain cover, is visible in the center of the foreground.  A person is visible in the far distance, adding a sense of scale and depth to the image. The overall impression is one of quiet solemnity and architectural grandeur." class="post-image">

The tower, once used for cementation in steel production, is dark reddish-brown with weathered bricks and a faded, patchy surface. A modern white metal structure is mounted at its top. Behind it are several mid-rise buildings with red, grey, and white facades, reflecting contemporary architecture. In the foreground lies a rough, dusty area with rubble, overgrown weeds, and metal fencing. The sky is clear and deep blue, casting strong, sharp shadows. The scene contrasts industrial heritage with urban development." class="post-image">
