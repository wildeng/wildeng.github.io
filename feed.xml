The colonnade is quite long, extending into the distance where it appears to darken and become less distinct.  The columns are tall and slender, classical in style, with bases and capitals.  Between the columns, there are walls with what appear to be stone or marble plaques or memorials, possibly tombstones, set into them.  Small floral arrangements are visible in some of these niches.  The floor of the colonnade is paved, and the shadows of the columns are cast long and distinctly on the ground, indicating a strong light source from one side.  A small, rectangular object, possibly a drain cover, is visible in the center of the foreground.  A person is visible in the far distance, adding a sense of scale and depth to the image. The overall impression is one of quiet solemnity and architectural grandeur." class="post-image" />

But long before that, two things shaped how I see the world: playing the guitar and coding on a C64.</p>

<p>I was 12 when I got my hands on that C64. My first coding projects were practical — I even wrote a program to try to win the <em>Totocalcio</em> (Italy’s football pool). It didn’t work, but the thrill of making the machine do what I wanted stuck with me. I also experimented with sprites and graphics, discovering the creative side of code.</p>

<p>At the same time, I was studying classical guitar while trying to replicate the sounds of Hendrix, Clapton, BB King, and Led Zeppelin by ear. Coding and music seemed like opposites — one technical, the other emotional — but over time, I realized they weren’t so different. Both require structure and creativity, precision and expression.</p>

<p>Around my thirties, I tried to get into film photography — this was around 2003 — but it didn’t click. Maybe I didn’t have the right information or the right mindset. So I stopped. Then about a year ago, I picked up digital photography more seriously, and now I’m back to film too. This time it feels different — partly because I’ve found some great people on Pixelfed who’ve shared the right suggestions at the right time.</p>

<p>That’s why, even now as a software engineer, I feel the need to do something artistic. Creativity and logic aren’t opposites — they feed each other and need each other. That’s why I’m sure many software engineers out there are doing some kind of creative work. It’s not just a balance — it’s part of what makes us good at both.</p>

But here we are, another 25th of December and another Ruby release!<br />
This time, Ruby 3.4 brings an array of fantastic features, including Prism as the default parser, improved performance, reduced memory usage for YJIT, and much more. I highly encourage you to explore all the updates.
What caught my attention the most, though is the introduction of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">it</code> parameter. Back in Ruby 2.7 the shorthand <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_1</code> block parameter was introduced allowing developers to write more concise
and elegant blocks. This enhancement made code more readable and intuitive.
The traditional approach is to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> symbol in a block, something like:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_1</code> (and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_2, _3</code>) parameters removes the need to explicit the block variable explicitely and so, the above code could be written as:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">_1</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">}</span>  <span class="c1"># _1 refers to each element in the array</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s take a look at another example:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]].</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">_1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">_2</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_1</code> refers to the first element of the array, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_2</code> to the second and so on. Ruby supports an unlimited number of block parameters allowing you to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_1,_2,_3</code> and so
on, depending on the number of arguments passed to the block.<br />
Ruby <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.4</code>, released today, introduced <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">it</code> as a reference to a block parameter with no variable name and it’s especially useful in the case of one parameter only or when the block operation is straightforward providing a more readable alternative
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_1</code> for developers unfamiliar with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_1</code>.</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>These approaches are particularly useful in situations where block variables have no semantic meaning, such as simple transformations or operations. However, in complex blocks or scenarios where parameter names add clarity, traditional syntax remains preferable.<br />
In conclusion, these block parameters are a useful tool to write more concise and readable block.</p>

<p>I think is enough writing for Christmas day, happy coding!</p>

While there are still some edge cases that I haven’t covered, and a few more improvements to be made, it’s coming along nicely.
If you want to take a look, I linked the repository in a previous post. <a href="https://github.com/wildeng/wildeng.github.io/blob/development/_scripts/blogpost.rb">Here’s the permalink to the latest version of the script</a>.<br />
Shifting gears, I’m finally working on something pretty interesting at my day job. It’s simple codewise, but the theory behind it has been engaging. I’ve been focusing on building predictors for young athletes.
 While these predictors aren’t complex from a technical perspective, they are quite powerful in terms of the insights they provide about athletic potential.</p>

<p>I’m finally doing some interesting things at work. Codewise they’re simple but I’m working on some predictors that are for young athletes and the theory behind them is interesting.<br />
One of the most fascinating methods I’ve encountered is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_J._Khamis#:~:text=Roche%2C%20Khamis%20developed%20the%20Khamis,to%20methods%20using%20skeletal%20age.">Khamis-Roche</a> method, which estimates a child’s adult height based on their current height, age, 
and their parents’ heights. This method is widely used and doesn’t require invasive procedures like X-rays, which makes it especially practical.</p>

<p>How the Khamis-Roche Method Works:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Inputs: The method takes the child’s current height, weight, age, and the average of the parents’ heights (mid-parental height).</li>
  <li>Mid-parental Height: This is calculated by averaging the father’s and mother’s heights.</li>
  <li>Gender Adjustment: The formula adds 5 inches (about 13 cm) for boys and subtracts the same amount for girls to account for typical growth patterns.</li>
  <li>Growth Data: The method considers the child’s current growth percentiles for a more accurate prediction.</li>
  <li>Accuracy: It’s around 95% accurate, especially for children aged 4 and older.</li>
  <li>Non-Invasive: Unlike other methods that rely on X-rays to estimate bone age, the Khamis-Roche method is completely non-invasive.</li>
  <li>Gender Differences: The formula is slightly adjusted for boys and girls to reflect different growth trajectories.
This method is straightforward and grounded in general growth trends, making it reliable and easy to apply.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve also realized that predicting the potential of a young athlete involves much more than just their technical abilities. It’s been eye-opening to see how various predictors, like growth patterns, influence assessments of athletic potential. 
These small discoveries have made my work feel less routine and more meaningful in recent days.</p>

I’m having that feeling that I still have so many things to do and learn (<a href="https://album.link/i/258622449">Kenny G.</a> is playing in the background) but the time left is not enough.
Despite this and the fact that I’m not that fast as a developer as before - never been a 10x though… more a 2x :smile: - I’m still enjoying writing in that bizarre language called “code” and share my small achievements in blog posts, even though I realized
that I have to write when I feel too and not with a predefined routine. This is what I am and I think I’m not going to change much… 
Anyway I enjoy writing with my usual editor (Neovim or Lunarvim) but I don’t enjoy copy pasting things around. More I was in the process of learning how to use the <a href="http://whatisthor.com">Thor</a> gem so I said to myself that probably the best thing to do learn how it works is building something wih it. 
It took me less than one hour to build an alpha version of my personal blogpost generator and you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/wildeng/wildeng.github.io/blob/55bac77ea91252e72c3c45f8b57593d20f3b0454/_scripts/blogpost.rb">here</a>. 
<br />
More, I already have in my mind some improvements:
<br />
Add some validations to the name and date passed as arguments 
<br />
Add the possibility to set up a customisable path for saving the file. I’m just thinking about how to organise posts e.g. by category 
<br />
Maybe add a file path to a template as a /a/ameter. In this way I could potentially change the structure of my posts and make the generator more general.</p>

<p>I probably have many more improvements in my mind but the music is almost over and the beer is finished - It’s a Saturday evening so I can indulge a bit more with drinks!</p>

By the way, I also added some animation to my career page, check it out!</p>

Can we determine whether an image is authentic or not? If someone claims an image is fake - e.g., Trump regarding a Kamala Harris rally -
can we produce documentation to prove its authenticity? And if so, will others be willing to accept the truth, or will they continue to believe what suits them best?
Italian researcher Walter Quattrociocchi, in an article for the financial newspaper <a href="https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/armarsi-contro-fake-news-strumenti-il-prebunking-e-debunking-AGTHB8W">Il Sole 24 ore</a>, explains that debunking doesn’t work, mostly because people stick to their mental models
even when confronted with the truth. This is where prebunking becomes useful.
Prebunking, also known as inoculation theory in communication studies, is a proactive approach to combating misinformation.
The goal of prebunking is to equip people with the skills to spot false and misleading information online before they encounter it, thereby preempting manipulation.
This method works by exposing individuals to weakened forms of misinformation and teaching them how to identify and counter deceptive tactics.</p>

<p>Key aspects of prebunking include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Education: Teaching critical thinking skills and common manipulation techniques used in misinformation.</li>
  <li>Exposure: Presenting mild doses of misinformation along with explanations of why it’s misleading.</li>
  <li>Practice: Allowing individuals to apply their new knowledge in controlled scenarios.</li>
  <li>Reinforcement: Regularly updating and reinforcing these skills as misinformation tactics evolve.</li>
</ol>

<p>By implementing prebunking strategies, the aim is to make online users more resilient to being misled in the future.
This approach acknowledges that prevention is often more effective than cure when it comes to battling the spread of misinformation in our digital age.</p>

<p>I’ve been back to Italy with the whole family after two years. Many things have changed, and I feel I belong to a different place now.
But still, when I come here, many sweet memories come to my mind, and I start questioning my past choices.
I guess it’s normal, given that I moved to the UK for two main reasons: better job opportunities for a Rubyist and putting some distance between myself and all the pressures my former life was
putting on me. 
Anyway, seeing what my kids have become and the happiness in my wife’s eyes is enough to say that our life has improved a lot,
despite Brexit and all the xenophobic rhetoric that comes from the British far right.</p>

<p>I want to learn how to solve a Rubik’s cube! :smile: I remember when I was a kid, back in the 80s, I had a Rubik’s cube and after scrambling it, I detached all the coloured stickers and
put them back in the right order, pretending I had solved it!</p>

<p>I’m reading “Ruby under a Microscope” again. Sometimes I need to refresh my understanding of the language, and I think that I know more about Ruby than I do about Rails.
This hasn’t always been valued during interviews. What fascinates me is the way the language handles different scenarios, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extend</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepend</code>,
the algorithms used to parse the code, and generally all the internal mechanisms that make my life as a developer easier.</p>

Whether it’s mastering camera settings or post-processing with Procreate,
I’m constantly learning. Speaking of Procreate, it’s been a blast playing around with adding color to black and white photos.
It’s taken me to some unexpected places creatively, like this one I’ve posted on my Pixelfed account:<br />

Thanks again to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/salwan-shimoun-43a0b8228">Sawan</a>.
It looks like a fantastic year for the conference, with so many interesting speakers.
I’m particularly looking forward to hearing from Nadia Odunayio, the developer behind The Story Graph (a fantastic alternative to Goodreads!), 
and Chris Oliver, the mind behind Go Rails. I’m also eager to learn more about Ruby Ractors from Daniel Vartanov’s talk. 
Having some experience with Goroutines, I’m curious about the similarities between the two for parallel processing.</p>

<h4 id="my-relation-with-llms">My relation with LLMs</h4>

<p>So far I’ve developed a cautios relationship with LLMs, sometimes I use them but I’ve got in the habit of checking the information provided, given the
frequent hallucinations they have. Still, although they are sometimes useful, I don’t feel that scraping the Internet to feed them without paying anything to
the people that crafted all that content is fair. In my eyes these companies just another wave of capitalists that are trying to make money by literally
stealing someone else’s work. Gary Marcus on <a href="https://x.com/GaryMarcus/status/1744362345403392510">X - Twitter</a> said it well, talking about OpenAI call for
copyright exemption to “save” ChatGPT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rough Translation: We won’t get fabulously rich if you don’t let us steal, so please don’t make stealing a crime!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that’s the right time to put some regulation in place, we cannot let these people do whatever they want without any kind of rule, they need to be
accountable for any kind of damage their activity can cause.</p>

<p>Will my job be replaced by LLMs or is this simply a new tool to learn and improve my daily workflow? <br />
I’m honestly worried about this and I started researching a bit around the argument and what I’ve found is not so encouraging at all.<br />
Take a look at what Jensen Huang Nvidia CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1761483377365152234">said</a>. Now, should we stop teaching Computer Science because AI will generate all the code we want by using natural language? Honestly, should we take the word of someone with a vested financial interest? I don’t think so, however his words are outlining a common trend that’s well explained in this post by <a href="https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/the-one-about-the-web-developer-job-market/">Baldur Bjarnason</a> which is a long one to summarize but let me put it in plain and simple words:<br />
As software engineers we are well paid and this, in the modern tech - and not only - corporate world is something that needs to be fixed with every means, and honestly this is what management believes: Read this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1axlbub/executive_leadership_believes_llms_will_replace/">Reddit</a> thread quoted in Bjarnason’s post, among other things.</p>

<p>The most positive approach I found so far is this by <a href="https://thenewstack.io/code-in-context-how-ai-can-help-improve-our-documentation/">Jon Udell</a> he thinks that LLms will help us understanding existing code rather than writing it, because of their “ability” to recognise patterns and summarise the findings. In his eyes this should improve the quality of the documentation and the overall quality of the code itself, that will for sure still be written by humans.</p>

<p>Now what should I do? Well, before moving to the Uk I was freelancing and I never put my eggs in one basket so I will try to diversify my knowledge again. By diversifying my skills with languages like Rust and Crystal, honing my writing abilities, and pursuing scrum master training - my company required it. What I do hope though is that human expertise in problem-solving and creative thinking will continue to be valuable in this field, despite the push to automate everything.</p>

Opting for the latter, I’ve decided to write a post whenever inspiration strikes, sharing thoughts that hold personal meaning rather than aiming solely for a wide audience. Writing is an enjoyable endeavor for me, serving as a way to capture discoveries, experiences, and thoughts in a cohesive order.</p>

<p>In my current job, I predominantly work on backend applications with occasional forays into frontend development. Despite the shift, I still find joy in working on simple HTML and CSS projects. Recently, I stumbled upon a fascinating book by <a href="https://htmlandcssbook.com">John Duckett</a> in a charity shop, published in 2011. Despite its age, the book encapsulates fundamental web development knowledge in an aesthetically pleasing format.</p>

<p>Beyond its technical insights, the book has become a valuable visual aid, helping me understand how different elements fit into a webpage. It’s not just about the technicalities; the book has inspired me to appreciate the artistry in web development. Although I often turn to search engines for quick answers, there’s a unique satisfaction in slowing down and leafing through a physical book.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, let me delve into the book’s influence on my work. The way it’s structured has not only enriched my technical understanding but also provided a visual framework for organizing elements on a page. This, coupled with the nostalgia of using a tangible resource, has added a unique layer to my learning experience.</p>

<p>HTML, a language I consider powerful, has granted countless individuals the ability to express themselves on the vast canvas of the internet. Despite the ongoing debate about whether HTML is a programming language, its significance in enabling digital expression cannot be overstated. As I continue my journey in web development, I find solace in the simplicity and potency of HTML, a language that empowers creativity on the worldwide web.</p>

<p>Here are two examples from the book:<br />

 The historical reason behind treating numbers with a leading 0 as octal in some programming languages, including Ruby, can be traced back to the influence of the C programming language.</p>

<p>In the C programming language, a numeric literal with a leading 0 is treated as an octal constant. This behavior was likely introduced to provide a convenient way to represent octal values directly in the source code. For example, in C:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int octalNumber = 0123;  // This represents the octal value of 83
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>a similar behaviour can be found in C++. C#, Java, JavaScript.</p>

<p>I’ve started learning touch typing, so far it’s been quite challenging and it needs a lot of practice and discipline. I’m honestly enjoying it and is likely one of those skills that could boost my self confidence. I’m following the free lessons at <a href="https://www.edclub.com/sportal/program-3.game">Typing Club</a></p>

<p>I’m making progress in my French studies on Duolingo and I’ve noticed that I’m now able to understand most of the material I’m reading as an aid to my lessons. Obviously I’m still at a beginner level and mainly using present tense. The journey is still long, but so far it’s been really interesting.
Talking about languages I’ve also enrolled in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friulian_language">Friulian</a> course. It’s a minority language spoken in the Italian region I’m from and even if I can understand it, like most of the people living there, I can’t speak it properly. Now is the time to fill this gap. It’s part of my culture and in some way it had influenced who I currently am, so definitely worth learning it.</p>

<p>I find the new iPhone journal app quite nice. It prompts some cool suggestions and it’s a way to keep track what you’ve done during the day or more than one if you’re not using it daily. I believe journalling is something than can help organise your thoughts and reflections at a moment in time.</p>
