      <h2><a href="/2023/12/28/blocks-procs-and-lambdas/">Blocks Procs and Lambdas</a></h2>
      <p>Ruby has three types of anonymous functions: Blocks, Procs and Lambdas.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/12/23/editor-sacred-graal/">The Sacred Graal of Editors</a></h2>
      <p>In my last post I said that I wanted to be more technical and so be it. But in a different way and not “so technical”: I won’t talk about classes, methods, modules, mixin or some other Ruby related stuff. I’m going to write about my journey in search of my “almost perfect” editor.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/12/17/a-few-misses/">A few misses</a></h2>
      <p>It’s been a while since the last post but I had a couple of things that took me away from writing: A Christmas concert with the choir and my job which is highly demanding  in this period. More, I was finding difficult to find a good subject so I guess that sometimes is it ok to put out something that I found interesting? I guess so even if I’m not that sure about it, but at least it keeps the flow going.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/11/28/to-feed-or-not-to-feed/">To Feed or not Too Feed</a></h2>
      <p>Recently I started reading about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/?utm_source=ownyourweb&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-03">Indie Web</a> movement, which is a people-focused alternative to the corporate owned one, and it really struck a chord.<br />
Principles like owning your content and being in control of what gets published are the things that got me started trying to understand how to build websites and to become a web developer.<br />
And after many years trying to use different platforms such as Wordpress, Medium, Dev etc. I went back to the most simple stuff: HTML, CSS and a simple RSS Feed - Atom to be honest.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/11/18/what-a-year/">1991 What a Year!</a></h2>
      <p>Personally it was quite an ordinary year, I didn’t have much time to study for the university because I was playing in a band and I didn’t have much time left. Honestly I was enjoying my time and not thinking too much about studying, but still doing a bit of programming on my C64c and exploring the UNIX mainframe of the University of Trieste IT department.</p>
