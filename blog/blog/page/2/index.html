      <p>AI-generated images are a problem, no more or less than “natural” ones. Can we determine whether an image is authentic or not? If someone claims an image is fake - e.g., Trump regarding a Kamala Harris rally -
can we produce documentation to prove its authenticity? And if so, will others be willing to accept the truth, or will they continue to believe what suits them best?
Italian researcher Walter Quattrociocchi, in an article for the financial newspaper <a href="https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/armarsi-contro-fake-news-strumenti-il-prebunking-e-debunking-AGTHB8W">Il Sole 24 ore</a>, explains that debunking doesn’t work, mostly because people stick to their mental models
even when confronted with the truth. This is where prebunking becomes useful.
Prebunking, also known as inoculation theory in communication studies, is a proactive approach to combating misinformation.
The goal of prebunking is to equip people with the skills to spot false and misleading information online before they encounter it, thereby preempting manipulation.
This method works by exposing individuals to weakened forms of misinformation and teaching them how to identify and counter deceptive tactics.</p>

      <p>In these past weeks, I haven’t had as much time to write as I’d like, given that work has been really demanding.
This is something I’m hoping to create more space for in the coming weeks. But even with a busy schedule,
I’ve been able to find moments to move forward with my French and Friulian studies, mostly during the evenings.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2024/04/09/ai-big-replacement/">Rise of the machines, are software engineers next?</a></h2>
      <p>Watching the rise of different tools that “can function as a fully autonomous software engineer”(<a href="https://easywithai.com/ai-developer-tools/devin/">Devin Introduction</a>) I’ve started thinking about the future of my job as a software engineer and obviously one big question came into my mind:</p>

      <p>Despite my best efforts to consistently publish blog posts, I’ve found it challenging to maintain the required level of commitment. Opting for the latter, I’ve decided to write a post whenever inspiration strikes, sharing thoughts that hold personal meaning rather than aiming solely for a wide audience. Writing is an enjoyable endeavor for me, serving as a way to capture discoveries, experiences, and thoughts in a cohesive order.</p>

      <p>While reading the <a href="https://kddnewton.com/2023/11/30/advent-of-prism-part-0">Advent of Prism</a> about the new Ruby parser that’s now been integrated into runtimes and tooling I came across something that I had overlooked:</p>
