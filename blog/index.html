      <p>Personally it was quite an ordinary year, I didn’t have much time to study for the university because I was playing in a band and I didn’t have much time left. Honestly I was enjoying my time and not thinking too much about studying, but still doing a bit of programming on my C64c and exploring the UNIX mainframe of the University of Trieste IT department.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/11/11/a-light-in-the-shadow/">A Light in the Shadow</a></h2>
      <p>The past week at work has been quite nice from a personal perspective. I’ve delivered a couple of nice cool features and sorted out an interesting bug.
I cannot say much about the contest but I’m working in a software company that creates tools for professional sport teams and we deal with games and periods. We thus had the following problem: After creating a game with a certain duration and a certain number of periods, the UI was always displaying 90 minutes and 2 periods of 45 minutes.

So I started tracing down the bug and found the cause: A case of variable shadowing.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/11/02/back-again/">Writing in a Rainy Day</a></h2>
      <p>Today I’m writing from a soggy Sheffield and this is probably the right time to open the laptop and start thinking about what to say. Finding the right topics is not an easy task, especially for someone that’s not used to “common” writing - I do write a lot of code during the day though <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> - and therefore I’m always scared of a blank page and that’s why I usually start by adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Things I like</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Today's links</code>. But when the topic has been decided, well words flow smoothly.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/10/28/back-to-blogging/">A New Start</a></h2>
      <p>It’s been a while since last time I wrote a blog post about something. I do not know what happened but I had the feeling that it wasn’t worth doing it anymore.
I think that my expectations were so high that it’s been hard accepting the truth: In the world outside there are so many people writing about anything, and some of them
are so good, that my posts were just a drop in a vast ocean of information.</p>
