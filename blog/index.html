      <h2><a href="/2023/11/02/back-again/">Writing in a Rainy Day</a></h2>
      <p>Today I’m writing from a soggy Sheffield and this is probably the right time to open the laptop and start thinking about what to say. Finding the right topics is not an easy task, especially for someone that’s not used to “common” writing - I do write a lot of code during the day though <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> - and therefore I’m always scared of a blank page and that’s why I usually start by adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Things I like</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Today's links</code>. But when the topic has been decided, well words flow smoothly.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/10/28/back-to-blogging/">A New Start</a></h2>
      <p>It’s been a while since last time I wrote a blog post about something. I do not know what happened but I had the feeling that it wasn’t worth doing it anymore.
I think that my expectations were so high that it’s been hard accepting the truth: In the world outside there are so many people writing about anything, and some of them
are so good, that my posts were just a drop in a vast ocean of information.</p>
